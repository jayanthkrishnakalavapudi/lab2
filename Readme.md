## Project Description

This project is an implementation of a simple contact management system using Node.js and Express.js. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing contacts. Users can view existing contacts, add new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete contacts.

## Development Environment

I developed this project on my personal computer running the following environment:

- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Node.js Version:** 16.13.1
- **Text Editor:** Visual Studio Code

## Installation/Running Instructions

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jayanthkrishnakalavapudi/lab2.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd lab2
    ```
3. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or another port if randomly generated).

## Insights and Results

During the development of this project, I learned how to create a RESTful API using Express.js and how to integrate middleware for request logging and data validation. I faced some challenges while implementing the edit functionality, particularly in updating the contact details and handling errors effectively. However, through debugging and referring to documentation, I managed to resolve these issues.

Overall, I gained a deeper understanding of Node.js, Express.js, and handling CRUD operations in a web application.
